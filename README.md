# Web-Programming

I took CS 380 (Programming for the Web) in Spring 2021.  My assignments are stored on a server at Athens State University.  The url to access these files is: http://mcs.athens.edu/~lseiber1/ 

Note: Some of the assignments are just screenshots of the working programs, since they were only designed to work locally.

Please contact me at levi.seibert@gmail.com if you have any questions.
